# Background

`vite-plugin-cdn-next` is a vite plugin that can replace `vite-plugin-cdn`,`vite-plugin-cdn-next` or others same as package.

## Principles

### Cover as many scenes as possible

Un like other plugins. `vite-plugin-cdn-next` can cover as many scenes as possbile. Such as `export * from 'module'`

### Friendy Options

If you are using `vite-plugin-cdn-import` you may write the follow option look like:

```js
import importToCDN from 'vite-plugin-cdn-import'

importToCDN({ modules: [{ name: 'react', var: 'React', path: 'umd/react.production.min.js' }] })
```

But now when you migrate to `vite-plugin-cdn-next`, you only need

```js
import { cdn } from 'vite-plugin-cdn-next'

cdn({ modules: ['react'] })
```

## Tradeoffs

### Don't support dynamic import

```js
async function dynamicImport() {
  const react = import('react')
  return react
}
```

In most of case, we won't use dynamic import to introduce some libraries.

### Use export all as little as possible

Although we support `export * from 'module'`. But in most of case we don't encourage
users to use it. Because it's a long transform task. And we only handle the duplicate node(Just remove duplicate node)
